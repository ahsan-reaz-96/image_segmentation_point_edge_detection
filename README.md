🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️How to detect a point:

A point (or blob) = a single pixel or a very small region that is much brighter/darker than its neighbors (e.g. a dot, speck, or small bright spot). The general idea: preprocess → compute a response that highlights points → threshold → filter/locate → (optionally) refine and display.

👍Method A — Simple kernel (Laplacian-like) — easy and fast
Steps:

🎈 Load & convert to grayscale.

🎈(Optional) Denoise with small Gaussian blur.

🎈Convolve with a point kernel (e.g. [-1 -1 -1; -1 8 -1; -1 -1 -1]).

🎈Take absolute value → threshold to get candidate points.

🎈Filter by connected-component area and compute centroids.

🎈(Optional) refine centroid positions (sub-pixel).

🎈Visualize / overlay.

👍Method B — Blob detector (OpenCV SimpleBlobDetector) — robust & parameterized

Good when blobs vary a bit and you want built-in filters for area, circularity, convexity.

👍Method C — DoG / LoG (scale-space) — multi-scale point detection

If points have varying sizes, use Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) or Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) and detect local maxima across scales.

🔑 What this does:

DoG (manual): subtracts two Gaussian blurred versions → points appear bright.

LoG (blob_log): more robust, finds blobs at multiple scales.


Red circles = DoG blobs.

Green circles = LoG blobs.

🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️How to detect edges:
🎈Load & grayscale — most edge detectors work on intensity.

🎈Denoise (Gaussian blur) — reduces spurious edges from noise.

🎈Compute gradient (Sobel) — measure how intensity changes (strength and direction).

🎈Get gradient magnitude — edge strength image.

🎈(Optional) Threshold / morphological ops — convert to a clean binary edge mask.

🎈Canny (recommended) — does smoothing → gradient → non-maximum suppression → hysteresis thresholding; gives thin, reliable edges.

🎈Post-processing / overlay / extract coordinates — clean edges, draw them on original, or get (x,y) coordinates.

👍Non-maximum suppression (NMS): keeps only pixels that are local maxima along the gradient direction — this is why Canny gives thin edges. Implementing NMS manually is doable but Canny already handles it.

👍Choosing thresholds: the median-based auto rule (sigma=0.33) often works well. Otherwise try different low/high values or use Otsu on gradient magnitude.

👍Edge linking / contours: use cv2.findContours() on the binary edge mask to get continuous boundary curves.

👍Sub-pixel edges: advanced methods refine edge location using interpolation (rarely needed for casual CV tasks).

👍Thin edges further: morphological thinning (e.g., Zhang-Suen) — available in skimage or cv2.ximgproc (contrib).

👍Detect lines: use Hough transform (cv2.HoughLinesP) on a thin edge image.

👍Noise: if you see many spurious edges, increase blur sigma or use bilateral filtering if you want to preserve strong edges while smoothing.
